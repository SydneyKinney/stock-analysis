# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code to make the VBA script run faster. The client wanted to analyze the entire stock market for the years 2017 and 2018. Analyzing this data would allow the client to determine if certain stocks are worth investing. Overall, refactoring the code will allow the VBA script to run more efficiently.  

## Results
###Analysis
After refactoring the code, the VBA script ran faster. Before the refactored code, the VBA script would run in about 0.63 seconds for both 2017 and 2018 datasets. After the refactored code, the VBA script ran in 0.12 seconds for 2017 and 0.13 seconds for 2018. That is about a 135% difference and that demonstrates how our refactored code is more efficient.

##Summary
###Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
Some advantages of refactoring code include reduced complexity, maintainability, cleaner code, and more. Overall, these advantages may lead to faster programming. Some disadvantages of refactoring code include new bugs, new errors, and may be more difficult for the customer to recognize. 

###Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring VBA Script
An advantage of refactoring VBA script is a decrease in macro run time. Our results demonstrate this advantage. A disadvantage of refactoring VBA scripts is that it may be time consuming. Refactoring may take more time while writing the code but will save more time in the future.
